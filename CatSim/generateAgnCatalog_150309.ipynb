      "Everything we have done up to this point has just been querying the database and spitting out the results of that query.  Applying variability requires the `InstanceCatalog` to read in the SED of each AGN, integrate it over the LSST bandpasses, and then apply a variability model.  Even that shouldn't take too long.  The most time-consuming part of that process is reading in the AGN SED and all of our model AGNs have the same SED.  The problem is that the getter for AGN magnitudes also calculates bulge and disk magnitudes (see `sims_photUtils/python/lsst/sims/photUtils/Photometry.py`).  Even if we don't want bulge and disk magnitudes, we still have to calculate them.  This involves inputting many more unique SEDs.  In the future, we hope to get around this problem by storing our SEDs as decomposition of PCA spectra.  Then, we only have to read in the few tens of SED PCA once and we can calculate object spectra by making linear combinations of those PCA.\n",

      "There is a work-around to this problem, though.  Since the problem is with reading in multiple disk and bulge SEDs which we actually do not want, we can hack the system by assigning every disk and bulge the same empty.  The way an `InstanceCatalog` resolves requests for column values is that, in this order, it:\n",

      "If we write a getter that assigns 'None' as the disk and bulge SEDs, that getter will override the information stored in the database, and we should speed up our query, since the `InstanceCatalog` will not waste time calculating disk and bulge magnitudes we don't want."
