    "First, some philosophy:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CatSim stack principally exists to create catalogs from simulated universes.  The default simulated universe that CatSim accesses lives on a machine at the University of Washington called \"fatboy\".  This simulated universe is really a <b>database</b> that consists of a distribution of galaxies drawn from the Millennium N-body simulation, and Milky Way stars generated with the GalFast software.  The most up-to-date documentation of what fatboy provides is here\n",
    "\n",
    "https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Database+Contents+--+Catalog+Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Database+Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever this notebook refers to \"querying the database,\" it is referring to this database on fatboy (it is possible, in principle, to connect CatSim to your own database containing your own simulated universe; that is beyond the scope of this demo).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>See the link below for instructions on how to access the fatboy database</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Accessing+the+UW+CATSIM+Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though catalogs are generated by querying fatboy's database, CatSim is designed so that the user should never have to write any raw SQL queries.  This is due to the way the catalog-generating classes in CatSim have been written.  In broad strokes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user instantiates a daughter of the <b>`InstanceCatalog`</b> class which is in charge of actually writing the catalog.  This is the class that contains information regarding what astronomical objects and what data regarding those objects should be written to the catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user passes the InstanceCatalog an instantiation of a daughter of the <b>`CatalogDBObject`</b> class.  The `CatalogDBObject` class is the class which actually manipulates the connection to fatboy.  Specific `CatalogDBobject` classes are written to connect to specific tables in the fatboy database.  Thus, there is one `CatalogDBObject` class for galaxies, a different `CatalogDBObject` class for Solar System objects, a different `CatalogDBObject` for main sequence stars, a different `CatalogDBObjec`t for white dwarfs, etc.  The full list of available `CatalogDBObject` daughter classes is here  https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Database+Schema.  `CatalogDBObject` daughter classes provide one other purpose: naming conventions for data columns vary between fatboy and the `InstanceCatalog` classes (and, indeed, between tables in fatboy).  Declination is called `dec` in the galaxy table but `decl` in the star tables.  `CatalogDBObject` classes provide simple mappings that smooth over these differences and put all of the database columns into a uniform syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user also passes the `InstanceCatalog` an instantiation of the <b>`ObservationMetaData`</b> class.  This is the class which contains data about the state of the simulated telescope.  For the purposes of generating a catalog, the `ObservationMetaData` provides the RA and Dec at which the telescope is pointed as well as the size and shape of its field of view (i.e. it controls the question \"which objects in fatboy's database are actually seen by my telescope and thus should be written to my catalog?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask your `InstanceCatalog` to write itself out, what actually happens is that the `CatalogDBObject` performs a query on fatboy using information from the `ObservationMetaData` to tell it which objects to return and information from the `InstanceCatalog` to tell it what data columns associated with those objects to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do that now.\n",
